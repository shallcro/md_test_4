  usageNotes: |+
    When inputting names of both organizational and individual PIs, the following hierarchy of authority control sources should be used to make sure those names conform to best practices within the TEST and broader academic community:
    
      1. If a PI already has published data with the TEST, conform to how their name has been displayed previously within our catalog.
      2. If a PI is in the [TEST Personal Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10002) or [Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), conform to TEST’s internal thesauri.
      3. If the PI is not available in TEST Authority Control sources, look up the PI in VIAF. 
      4. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source, such as Google Scholar or a C.V. published on their institution’s website, can be used to ensure their inputted name conforms to how their name is typically published.

    For names of people: 
      
      * The First name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.'). 
      * There is no space between first and middle initials.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged (especially 'et al.') but suffixes such as 'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.  

    For names of organizations:

      * Include the full hierarchy of the organization, going from the highest level down to the most specific. Note that the higher level of the organization must be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g.,'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').
      * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice')
