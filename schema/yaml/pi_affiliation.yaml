    The following steps should be taken to ensure that the entry of PI affiliation names conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:

      1. If the PI already has published data with TEST, conform to how their affliation has been displayed previously within the TEST catalog.
      2. If the PIâ€™s affiliated organization is in the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), use the form of the name as listed there.
      3. If the affiliated organization is not available in the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), consult the [Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/) (VIAF). 
      4. If the affliated organization does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source (such as the organization's website) to determine the appropriate name.
    
    Additional points regarding the names of organizations:
      
      * If a PI's organizational affiliation is not known, use the term 'Unknown' for the PI affiliation element.
      * If the list of PIs includes multiple people affiliated with the same organization, include the affiliated organization's name for each person.
      * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').
      * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice').
