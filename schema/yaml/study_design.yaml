  usageNotes: |
    The Study Design provides more detailed information than the Summary, including how surveys were prepared and administered, how interviews were conducted, or how the data were obtained and compiled, as well as information about deadlines and follow-ups to respondents.
  icpsrGuidance: |
    It is acceptable to summarize information contained in study documentation and point users to that study documentation for more details. If the Summary already contains text that would be appropriate in Study Design, it is acceptable to duplicate that text.
