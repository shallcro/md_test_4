  usageNotes: |
    The textual description ('time frame') is used to add context to the Time Period when multiple time periods exist (e.g., to describe different waves, dataset names, or fiscal year designation) and/or when the date cannot be expressed exclusively through numbers, such as seasons or other units of time where the data producer did not clarify the exact dates they meant.

    The textual description should not simply restate the time period in words. For example, if the Time Period is 2020-01, the Time Frame should not be 'January 2020'.
