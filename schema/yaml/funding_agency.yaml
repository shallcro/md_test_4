  usageNotes: |
    The following steps should be taken to make sure that the entry of funding agency names conforms to best practices within TEST and the broader academic community:

      1. If the funding organization has sponsored data with TEST in the past, conform to previously usage within the TEST catalog.
      2. If the organization has not previously sponsored data but is in the [TEST Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/TEST/thesaurus/10004), use the form of the name listed there.
      3. If the funding organization is not available in the TEST Organizational Names Authority List, consult the [Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/) (VIAF). 
      4. If the funding organization does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source (such as an organizational website) to determine the appropriate name.
