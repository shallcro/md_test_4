  usageNotes: |
    Version numbers are integers without leading zeros. Versioning begins when a data collection is first archived. Each subsequent update of the data collection increments the version number by 1. The version number is incremented when modifying or adding:
    
      * Data files, including additions of datasets or supplemental data files, additional masking, increasing curation level, or resupplied datasets
      * Documentation files
      * SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) files
    
    Metadata-only updates to the data collection do not increment the version number. Changes to the version number require a textual summary to be added to Changes to Collection.
