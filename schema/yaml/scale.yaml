  usageNotes: |
    The inclusion of a common scale should be identified in the documentation associated with this dataset and confirmed by variable names or labels. The scales can be cited either as a list or described in full sentences. If the questionnaire used has a finite list of responses (e.g., 'Always, Sometimes, Rarely, Never' or Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree'), it is acceptable for this element to note 'A Likert-type scale was used,' or 'Several Likert-type scales were used.' However, it is not required to note Likart-type scales in situations where only such scales were used, given their ubiquity.
